**Easy Fullbright Mod for Minecraft**  

This simple mod adds a key binding (default: **G**) to toggle brightness control, letting you see clearly even in the dark. You can easily change the key in the Controls menu.  

**Note:** This only adjusts the gamut but may be seen as an unfair advantage. Check your server’s rules before using it—proceed at your own risk.  

**Requirements:**  
- Forge  

**Installation:**  
1. Download and install the **recommended Forge version**.  
2. Drop the Fullbright mod file into your **mods folder**.  
3. Done! Enjoy better visibility.
